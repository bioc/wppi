Description: Protein-protein interaction data is essential for omics data
    analysis and modeling. Database knowledge is general, not specific for
    cell type, physiological condition or any other context determining which
    connections are functional and contribute to the signaling. Functional
    annotations such as Gene Ontology and Human Phenotype Ontology might help
    to evaluate the relevance of interactions. This package predicts
    functional relevance of protein-protein interactions based on functional
    annotations such as Human Protein Ontology and Gene Ontology, and
    prioritizes genes based on network topology, functional scores and a path
    search algorithm.
